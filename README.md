This project aims to determine whether or not home court advantage is statistically significant or not in the National Basketball Association (NBA) through Exploratory Data Analysis. This project uses NBA data from Kaggle from 1950-2010. The variables in the dataset include year, team name, number of home wins, number of away wins, total season wins, as well as the percentages of home wins, away wins and overall season wins.
